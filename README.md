## Technologies Used

- **React**: Utilized for creating the frontend, providing an interactive and responsive user interface where users can securely add, edit, and view their passwords. React components are designed to handle user interactions and display data dynamically.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling the frontend with a modern and mobile-friendly design, ensuring a seamless user experience across different screen sizes.

- **Node.js & Express**: Power the backend server, handling API requests from the frontend. Express is used to define the API routes and connect the frontend to the database for secure password management operations.

- **MongoDB**: Acts as the database to store user credentials securely. Each password is stored with encryption, ensuring only authenticated users can access their data.

- **JSON Web Token (JWT)**: Provides authentication, enabling users to securely log in and access their accounts. JWTs ensure each session is unique and access is restricted to authorized users only.
